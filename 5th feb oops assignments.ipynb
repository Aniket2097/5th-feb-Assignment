    "Q1. Explain Class and Object with respect to Object-Oriented Programming. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - An object is simply a collection of data (variables) and methods (functions). Similarly, a class is a blueprint for that object.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is considered as a blueprint of objects. We can think of the class as a sketch (prototype) of a house. It contains all the details about the floors, doors, windows, etc. Based on these descriptions we build the house. House is the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since many houses can be made from the same description, we can create many objects from a class.\n",

    "Q3. Explain why the __init__() function is used. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "\n",

    "Q4. Why self is used in OOPs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - The self variable is used to represent the instance of the class which is often used in object-oriented programming. It works as a reference to the object. Python uses the self parameter to refer to instance attributes and methods of the class."
